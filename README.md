  - Use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or NeetCode guides.
  - Do 2-3 easy/medium problems daily.

## Week 2: Intermediate & Project Building

### Frontend Development
- **Advanced React**
  - Learn React Hooks (`useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`).
  - Explore performance optimization and lazy loading components.
- **Styling**
  - Experiment with CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled-Components or Tailwind CSS.
- **Testing**
  - Write simple tests with Jest and React Testing Library.

### Backend Development
- **Authentication**
  - Implement JWT authentication for a simple app.
  - Use third-party OAuth providers (e.g., Google Login) if possible.
- **Deployment**
  - Deploy a simple Node.js backend to platforms like Heroku or Render.
  - Deploy a React app on Vercel.

### Interview Prep
- **Algorithms**
  - Focus on HashMaps, Sets, and Binary Search.
  - Solve 2-3 problems daily.
- **System Design**
  - Learn how to design simple systems like URL shorteners or chat apps.

## Week 3: Advanced Topics & Portfolio

### Frontend Development
- **Frameworks & Libraries**
  - Explore popular libraries like Axios, Formik, or Chart.js.
- **Animations**
  - Practice creating animations using CSS transitions or libraries like Framer Motion.
- **Accessibility (a11y)**
  - Learn WCAG guidelines and test with tools like Axe or Lighthouse.

### Backend Development
- **APIs**
  - Work with external APIs: Fetch weather data or integrate with a payment gateway like Stripe.
- **WebSockets**
  - Learn how to build a real-time chat or notification feature.

### Portfolio Project
- **Build a Full-Stack Project**
  - Example: Task Manager with authentication, CRUD tasks, and deployment.
  - Use React + Node.js + PostgreSQL (or MongoDB if you're interested in NoSQL).

### Interview Prep
- **Algorithms**
  - Focus on Trees, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming.
  - Solve 2-3 medium problems daily.
- **Mock Interviews**
  - Practice mock interviews with a peer or mentor on platforms like Pramp.

## Week 4: Final Polishing & Applications

### Portfolio
- **Ensure your portfolio highlights 2-3 projects with live demos and GitHub links:**
  - Frontend-Only Project (e.g., Weather App with React).
  - Full-Stack Project (e.g., E-commerce app).
  - Collaborative Project (if possible).

### Resume & LinkedIn
- **Update your resume to emphasize:**
  - Skills: TypeScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL.
  - Projects: Brief descriptions with tech stacks used.
- **Optimize LinkedIn for recruiters.**

### Interview Prep
- **Behavioral Questions**
  - Review common behavioral questions (STAR format).
- **Algorithms**
  - Continue solving problems from different topics.

### Job Applications
- Apply to 5-10 jobs daily:
  - Tailor your resume and cover letter to highlight relevant skills and projects.
  - Use platforms like LinkedIn, AngelList, and Indeed.

## Tips for December
- **Consistency Matters**: Stick to 6-8 hours of daily preparation.
- **Seek Feedback**: Have peers or mentors review your code/projects.
- **Focus on Weaknesses**: Dedicate more time to TypeScript and algorithms.
- **Stay Healthy**: Take regular breaks to avoid burnout.
